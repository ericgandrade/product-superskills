## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
- **After any important change, run `/graphify --update` before ending the session.** Important changes include: adding or removing a skill, modifying SKILL.md or README.md of any skill, bumping version, or any structural refactor. Do not skip this step — an outdated graph leads to stale answers in future sessions.
