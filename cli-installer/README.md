```bash
# Interactive smart installation
npx product-superskills

# Auto smart update/install

See [Installation Guide](../docs/INSTALLATION.md) for full setup and troubleshooting.

## What It Does

1. Detects installed AI tools and IDEs.
2. Downloads the matching skills release into a local cache.
3. Compares installed skill versions with the current installer version.
4. Recommends smart updates for outdated or missing skills.
5. Copies skills into each platform's global skills directory.
6. If Claude Cowork is detected and selected, generates a plugin zip and prints manual upload instructions.

Installation is always global. Local repository scope is no longer supported.

## Supported Platforms

## Notes

- The installer downloads skills from GitHub and caches them locally before copying them into platform directories.
- The installer compares installed skill versions with `v1.21.7` and recommends updates automatically.
- Skills are authored in the repository `skills/` directory only; platform directories are installation targets, not source directories.
- Claude Cowork updates are manual by design: generate the zip, remove the previous `product-superskills` plugin in Cowork, then upload the new zip.
