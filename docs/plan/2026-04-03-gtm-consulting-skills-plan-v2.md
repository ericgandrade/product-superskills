# GTM Consulting Skills — Implementation Plan v2

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Add 7 skills to claude-superskills covering the complete GTM cycle for Microsoft consulting — from ICP to co-sell, from qualification to account expansion. Fills a gap not covered by `abx-strategy`, `product-strategy`, or `startup-growth-strategist`.

**Architecture:** Single-source-of-truth model. Each skill lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` + `skills/<name>/README.md`. Minimal frontmatter (name, description, license only). No version bump until skills are complete and validated. Implementation in 2 batches with an approval gate between them.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown skill files, YAML frontmatter, validation scripts (`validate-skill-yaml.sh`, `validate-skill-content.sh`), Python index generators.

**Context:** Eric Andrade, VP/Client Solutions Lead, Avanade Brazil. Responsible for creating and improving GTMs for Microsoft consulting offers (Assessment, System Integration, Outsourcing, Shared Services). Internal operational segmentation: MVC / High Growth / Emerging / Whitespace. Pillars: AI Business Solutions | Security | Cloud & AI Platforms | Advisory.

**Reference documents used in this plan:**
- `GTM_Mastery_Avanade.md` — 8 GTM pillars, coverage model, co-sell strategy, common GTM gaps
- `MASTER_21_Frameworks_Vendas.md` — 21 sales frameworks adapted to Avanade context with scripts

## Session Context (Session State on 2026-04-03)

### Current Status

- ✅ Plan v2 written and saved in this file
- ✅ Plan v1 (`2026-04-03-gtm-consulting-skills-plan.md`) still exists — superseded by this v2
- ⏳ **No skill has been implemented yet** — next step is Batch 1
- ⏳ Batch 1 awaiting approval/execution: `microsoft-consulting-icp` + `consulting-gtm-designer`
- ⏳ Batch 2 awaiting Batch 1 completion + review

### Immediate Next Step

Execute Batch 1 with `executing-plans`:
1. `skills/microsoft-consulting-icp/SKILL.md` + `README.md`
2. `skills/consulting-gtm-designer/SKILL.md` + `README.md`
3. Regenerate indexes
4. Validate with scripts

### Skills Usage Flow (how Eric would use them day-to-day)

```
STRATEGY (quarterly)
    ↓
microsoft-consulting-icp        → "Who should I pursue?" (ICP by tier × offer)
consulting-gtm-designer         → "How do I sell to them?" (GTM Canvas)
microsoft-cosell-strategy       → "How do I leverage Microsoft?" (co-sell + funding)

EXECUTION (per opportunity)
    ↓
presales-qualifier              → "Is it worth investing pre-sales in this deal?"
executive-account-briefing      → "How do I prepare for the C-level meeting?"
consulting-pursuit-governance   → "How do I govern this active pursuit?"

EXPANSION (per existing account)
    ↓
consulting-account-expansion    → "How do I grow revenue in this account?"
```

### External Repositories Identified (not yet triaged)

Eric identified 10 public GTM skills repositories for future analysis. These may be relevant for **GTM for product (PRD)** — not for consulting services, which is the focus of this plan.

**Repositories for future triage (PRD GTM):**
- https://github.com/iamachilles/gtm-skills-os/tree/main/skills
- https://github.com/kenny589/gtm-flywheel
- https://github.com/gooseworks-ai/goose-skills
- https://github.com/GTM-Strategist/gtm-strategist-skills
- https://github.com/gtmagents/gtm-agents
- https://github.com/onvoyage-ai/gtm-engineer-skills
- https://github.com/sachacoldiq/ColdIQ-s-GTM-Skills
- https://github.com/ivangfalco/gtm-skills
- https://github.com/Prospeda/gtm-skills
- https://github.com/Othmane-Khadri/gtm-agent-playbook

**Initial assessment (without full triage):**
- The `GTM_Mastery_Avanade.md` and `MASTER_21_Frameworks_Vendas.md` docs are sufficient for the 7 consulting skills in this plan
- For **PRD GTM** skills (SaaS, PLG, trial conversion, ARR/NRR metrics), the above repositories have more potential
- The 21 frameworks have useful ingredients for PRD too (JOLT for trial-to-paid, SPIN for demo, GAP Selling for demo narrative) — but the structural base would need product references (April Dunford, Wes Bush)
- Triage of these repos should happen in a separate session, following the process in `obsidian-skills-adoption-plan.md` as a model

### Fixed Design Decisions (do not revert)

1. **Primary segmentation:** MVC / High Growth / Emerging / Whitespace (not Enterprise/SMC)
2. **Hero Offer:** recommended entry option for Whitespace/Emerging — NEVER a mandatory gate
3. **Arc Assessment → SI → Outsourcing:** a possible path, not a forced sequence
4. **Differentiation from abx-strategy:** that skill is for generic B2B; these are for Microsoft consulting
5. **Framework source:** the 21 frameworks are used as adapted ingredients to the Avanade context, not copied verbatim

### Frontmatter Rules (critical — Claude Code breaks if wrong)

```yaml
---
name: kebab-case-name
description: This skill should be used when... (single line)
license: MIT
---
```

**PROHIBITED in SKILL.md:** `version`, `author`, `platforms`, `category`, `tags`, `risk`, `created`, `updated` — these cause loading errors in Claude Code.
**These fields belong in README.md** in the `## Metadata` table.

## Operational Segmentation (Base for All Skills)

| Tier | Criteria | Motion |
|------|----------|--------|
| **MVC** | $5M+ Revenue with Avanade | BDE (Business Development Executive). Named coverage. Full pursuit governance. |
| **High Growth** | $1.1M–$4.9M Revenue | BDE. Named coverage. Expansion-focused. |
| **Emerging** | >$1M Revenue (expected growth) | DDC (Digital Demand Center) + BDE hybrid |
| **Whitespace** | Net new — no relationship | DDC. Digital first. Hero Offer as optional entry. |

> **Hero Offer rule:** Hero Offers (fixed-fee, $30–75K, 2–6 weeks) are the **recommended entry option for Whitespace and Emerging**, not a mandatory gate. The client can buy SI directly if the context supports it. The goal is to sell.

---

## Decision Gates

1. ✅ Batch 1 skills approved (microsoft-consulting-icp, consulting-gtm-designer)
2. ⏳ User approves Batch 1 after implementation and review
3. ⏳ User approves Batch 2 before implementing (presales-qualifier, consulting-pursuit-governance, executive-account-briefing, microsoft-cosell-strategy, consulting-account-expansion)

---

## Batch 1: Priority Skills

### Skill 1: `microsoft-consulting-icp`

**Purpose:** Define ICP for Microsoft consulting engagements segmented by account tier (MVC/HG/Emerging/Whitespace) and offer type. Includes buyer persona mapping per offer, PURE scoring adapted to the Avanade/Microsoft context, and explicit Anti-ICP to protect pipeline quality.

**Why not `abx-strategy`?** `abx-strategy` targets generic B2B with <500 accounts and SaaS. This skill is specific to: Microsoft platform consulting, Avanade/Microsoft ecosystem dynamics, MVC/HG/Emerging/Whitespace segmentation, and differences in the buyer committee between a CIO buying an Assessment vs. a CFO approving a 3-year Outsourcing contract.

**Integrated frameworks:** PURE (scoring), Strategic Selling / Miller Heiman (Economic Buyer, User Buyer, Technical Buyer, Coach), TAS quadrant model (INVEST/DEVELOP/HARVEST/OPPORTUNISTIC).

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Who is my ICP for Assessment in MVC?"
- "What is the ideal account profile for Outsourcing in High Growth?"
- "Help define ICP for my SI offer in Whitespace"
- "I need to map the buying committee for an MVC account in Shared Services"
- "Define Anti-ICP for our Cloud offer in Emerging"

---

#### Task 1.1: Create `skills/microsoft-consulting-icp/SKILL.md`

# Microsoft Consulting ICP

Define Ideal Customer Profiles for Microsoft consulting engagements, segmented by account tier and offer type.

## Purpose

Define Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) for Microsoft platform consulting engagements. Segments accounts by Avanade's operational tiers (MVC, High Growth, Emerging, Whitespace), maps buyer personas per offer type, applies PURE scoring adapted to professional services context, and produces explicit Anti-ICP to protect win-rate and pipeline quality.

## When to Use

- Designing or refreshing GTM for a specific consulting offer
- Qualifying whether an account is viable for a given offer type and tier
- Mapping the buying committee before engaging an account
- Reviewing pipeline quality against ICP criteria
- Training pre-sales teams on qualification standards
- Deciding whether to pursue a Whitespace account via Hero Offer vs. direct SI motion

## Progress Tracking

```
[████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 25% — Phase 1/4: Account Tier Classification
[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 50% — Phase 2/4: Offer-Fit Scoring (PURE)
[████████████░░░░░░░░] 75% — Phase 3/4: Buyer Committee Mapping
[████████████████████] 100% — Phase 4/4: Anti-ICP Definition
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Account Tier Classification

Classify the account using Avanade's operational segmentation:

| Tier | Revenue Signal | Relationship Signal | Motion |
|------|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| **MVC** | $5M+ with Avanade | Named, strategic, exec relationship active | BDE-led. Full pursuit governance. Priority co-sell. |
| **High Growth** | $1.1M–$4.9M | Named, expansion runway visible | BDE-led. Expansion-focused. Upsell plays active. |
| **Emerging** | >$1M potential | Limited or early relationship | DDC + BDE hybrid. Assessment or Hero Offer as entry. |
| **Whitespace** | No current revenue | No relationship | DDC-led. Digital first. Hero Offer as optional entry point. |

Collect firmographic signals: revenue, employee count, IT budget, Microsoft maturity (M365/Azure adoption level), existing Avanade relationship depth, vertical (FSI, HPS, CMT, PRD, ERG, EXP).

Apply TAS quadrant logic to MVC/HG accounts:
- **INVEST:** High strategic value + strong relationship → full coverage
- **DEVELOP:** High strategic value + weak relationship → relationship building first
- **HARVEST:** Lower strategic value + strong relationship → efficiently monetize, standardize
- **OPPORTUNISTIC:** Lower strategic value + weak relationship → pursue only if inbound or low-cost entry

### Phase 2: Offer-Fit Scoring (PURE Model)

Score fit for each offer type using PURE:

| Criterion | Question | Score 0–3 |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **P**ain | How acute is the operational/strategic pain driving this purchase? | 0=mild, 3=severe |
| **U**rgency | Is there a forcing function (regulatory deadline, exec mandate, contract expiring)? | 0=none, 3=imminent |
| **R**eadiness | Does the organization have budget approved and governance to buy? | 0=not ready, 3=ready now |
| **E**conomics | Is there visible ROI or cost reduction that justifies the offer price? | 0=unclear, 3=explicit |

**Offer-specific fit signals:**

- **Assessment ($15K–$80K):** CIO/CTO sponsor exists; technology debt visible; Azure or M365 already adopted; digital transformation pressure active; budget for discovery allocated. Also valid as Hero Offer for Whitespace/Emerging entry.
- **System Integration ($150K–$2M+):** Budget confirmed; project scope definable; Microsoft platform selected or in active evaluation; decision expected within quarter; IT governance in place. Can be first offer if relationship and qualification support it — Hero Offer NOT required as gate.
- **Outsourcing (multi-year):** CFO involved; operational cost pressure explicit; FTE headcount at risk or restructuring active; multi-year commitment appetite exists; SLA expectations defined.
- **Shared Services:** CSC or GBS structure exists or planned; process standardization mandate active; scale across geographies required; CFO/COO sponsorship.

**Tier assignment:**
- 10–12: Tier 1 — pursue actively, full pre-sales investment
- 7–9: Tier 2 — qualify further before investing
- 4–6: Tier 3 — nurture, no pre-sales investment
- 0–3: Discard

### Phase 3: Buyer Committee Mapping

Map using Strategic Selling (Miller Heiman) roles:

| Role | Definition | Per Offer Type |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | Final financial authority | Assessment: CIO/CFO; SI: CIO+CFO; Outsourcing: CFO; Shared Services: CFO/COO |
| **User Buyer** | Day-to-day operational impact | Assessment: IT Director; SI: Project Sponsor; Outsourcing: COO/Ops; Shared Services: Process Owner |
| **Technical Buyer** | Technical evaluation and risk | Assessment: IT Architecture; SI: IT Architecture+Security; Outsourcing: IT+Legal; Shared Services: IT+HR |
| **Coach** | Internal advocate with political will | Must identify before investing pre-sales hours |

For each stakeholder document: title, primary concern, success metric, likely objection, messaging angle, engagement status (Cold/Warm/Engaged).

Champion identification rule: No named coach = no pre-sales investment beyond initial qualification call.

### Phase 4: Anti-ICP Definition

Define explicitly who NOT to pursue per offer type and tier:

**Universal Anti-ICP signals (disqualify regardless of tier):**
- No Microsoft investment (no M365, no Azure, competitive lock-in)
- Procurement-only contact without executive sponsor identified
- Budget not allocated with approval cycle >18 months
- No internal champion or coach accessible
- RFP-only relationship without prior engagement
- Single-vendor mandate to a direct competitor
- Active contract with competing SI at full capacity

**Tier-specific Anti-ICP:**
- **Whitespace:** No digital transformation signal, purely price-driven RFP, no Microsoft partner ecosystem engagement
- **Emerging:** Leadership not aligned on technology investment, no budget owner reachable through DDC
- **MVC/HG:** Relationship stalled at IT level only with no path to economic buyer, previous delivery issue unresolved

## Critical Rules

- NEVER score an account without identifying a named executive sponsor — no sponsor = Discard regardless of firmographics
- NEVER conflate tier motions — MVC and Whitespace have fundamentally different buying governance, cycle length, and commercial structure
- ALWAYS define Anti-ICP before presenting ICP to a pre-sales team — without it, the ICP will be gamed
- ALWAYS map the buyer committee before proposing — knowing only the IT contact is insufficient for any offer beyond a small Assessment
- NEVER use generic ICP criteria — every output must reference the specific account tier AND offer type being evaluated
- NEVER force Hero Offer as a prerequisite for SI — if the account context supports direct SI qualification, proceed

## Example Usage

1. "Define ICP for Assessment in the MVC tier in the FSI sector — entering Bradesco with a new AI offer"
2. "Score this account for Outsourcing: High Growth, CMT sector, $2M potential, CFO recently replaced, LGPD mandatory"
3. "Map the buying committee for a $500K SI project at Safra — we already have the IT Director as a contact"
4. "Review my Emerging pipeline — apply Anti-ICP and tell me which opportunities to discard"
5. "What is the Whitespace account profile that justifies a Hero Offer for AI Assessment before proposing SI?"
```

**Step 3: Validate**

```bash
./scripts/validate-skill-yaml.sh skills/microsoft-consulting-icp
./scripts/validate-skill-content.sh skills/microsoft-consulting-icp
```
Expected: no errors, word count 1500–2000

## Overview

Designed for Avanade Microsoft consulting practices. Maps the ICP question across Avanade's four operational account tiers (MVC, High Growth, Emerging, Whitespace) and four offer types (Assessment, System Integration, Outsourcing, Shared Services).

Produces a structured ICP profile including: PURE opportunity scoring, buyer committee mapping using Strategic Selling roles (Economic Buyer, User Buyer, Technical Buyer, Coach), and Anti-ICP definition to protect win-rate and pre-sales investment quality.

Different from generic B2B ICP tools — this skill is built around the Microsoft/Avanade co-sell model, Brazilian enterprise verticals (FSI, HPS, CMT, PRD), and the specific governance and buying dynamics of consulting services vs. software products.

## When to Use

- Designing or refreshing GTM for a consulting offer
- Qualifying a specific account/opportunity before investing pre-sales hours
- Mapping buyer committees for pursuit governance
- Reviewing pipeline against ICP criteria
- Training pre-sales and BDE teams on qualification standards

## Example Outputs

**ICP Profile:** Account Tier + Offer Type → PURE Score → Committee Map → Recommended Motion

**Anti-ICP Checklist:** Universal disqualifiers + tier-specific signals → Go/No-Go recommendation

**TAS Quadrant Assignment:** INVEST / DEVELOP / HARVEST / OPPORTUNISTIC for MVC/HG accounts
```

---

### Skill 2: `consulting-gtm-designer`

**Purpose:** Build GTM strategy for Microsoft platform consulting offers targeting Avanade's account tiers. Produces a GTM canvas per offer type with value prop per pillar, entry motion, expansion arc, and win metrics.

**Why not `product-strategy`?** `product-strategy` is for product companies (PLG vs SLG, pricing tiers, freemium). This skill is for professional services: offer packaging, consulting motions, pre-sales governance, Assessment → SI → Outsourcing arc as strategic expansion.

**Hero Offer rule:** Hero Offer is the recommended entry option for Whitespace/Emerging — it is NOT a mandatory gate. The skill presents the Assessment → SI → Outsourcing arc as a possible path, not a forced sequence.

**Integrated frameworks:** Force Management (Required Capabilities, Proof Points, Business Outcomes), GAP Selling (Current State → Future State → Gap Impact), Challenger Selling (Tailor pillar for executive value prop).

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Build the GTM for AI Assessment in the MVC tier — FSI sector"
- "How do I enter Whitespace accounts with a Cloud & AI offer?"
- "Structure the GTM for Outsourcing in High Growth — CMT sector"
- "What is the expansion strategy from an Assessment to SI at Bradesco?"
- "Define value prop per pillar for Shared Services in the HPS segment"

# Consulting GTM Designer

Build Go-To-Market strategy for Microsoft platform consulting offers by account tier and offer type.

## Purpose

Builds complete GTM strategy for Microsoft platform consulting offers (Assessment, System Integration, Outsourcing, Shared Services) across Avanade's account tiers (MVC, High Growth, Emerging, Whitespace). Covers offer positioning, value proposition by Microsoft GTM pillar, entry motion design, expansion arc planning, pre-sales governance gates, and win metrics. Produces a GTM canvas per offer-tier combination that a sales team can execute without ambiguity.

## When to Use

- Designing or refreshing GTM for a specific consulting offer type and account tier
- Defining value proposition differentiation across Microsoft pillars (AI Business Solutions, Security, Cloud & AI Platforms, Advisory)
- Planning entry motion for a new account tier or vertical
- Structuring expansion arc from entry offer to larger engagements
- Reviewing pipeline strategy alignment with account tier coverage model
- Deciding whether Hero Offer is the right entry motion for a specific context

## Progress Tracking

```
[████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 25% — Phase 1/4: Offer × Tier Definition
[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 50% — Phase 2/4: Value Proposition by Pillar
[████████████░░░░░░░░] 75% — Phase 3/4: Entry and Expansion Motion
[████████████████████] 100% — Phase 4/4: Win Metrics and GTM Canvas
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Offer × Tier Definition

Identify the combination to design GTM for:

**Offer types:**
- **Assessment** ($15K–$80K, 2–6 weeks): Discovery, diagnosis, roadmap. Entry offer. Fixed-fee possible. Also functions as Hero Offer when packaged for Whitespace/Emerging digital-first motion.
- **System Integration** ($150K–$2M+, 3–18 months): Build, configure, deploy. Can be first offer in MVC/HG if direct qualification supports it — Assessment NOT required as gate.
- **Outsourcing** (multi-year, recurring revenue): Operate, manage, run. Expansion offer. Requires delivery credibility or reference.
- **Shared Services** (multi-year, cross-geography): Standardize and centralize processes. Strategic expansion. Requires executive sponsorship and GBS/CSC maturity at client.

**Account tier implications for GTM design:**

| Tier | Sales Motion | Typical Entry | Pre-Sales Budget | Cycle Length |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| MVC | BDE-led, relationship-first, exec access | Assessment or direct SI | High — justify with PURE Tier 1 | 3–12 months |
| High Growth | BDE-led, expansion-focused | Assessment or SI | Medium — qualify at PURE Tier 2+ | 2–9 months |
| Emerging | DDC + BDE hybrid | Hero Offer or Assessment | Low — DDC digital first | 2–6 months |
| Whitespace | DDC-led, digital first | Hero Offer (optional) or direct SI if qualified | Minimal until qualified | 1–4 months |

Define scope: what is included in the offer, what is explicitly out, typical team composition, commercial structure (T&M, Fixed Fee, or Hybrid).

### Phase 2: Value Proposition by Pillar

For each Microsoft GTM pillar, build value prop specific to the offer type and account tier. Apply GAP Selling: Current State (current pain) → Future State (desired outcome) → Gap Impact (cost of doing nothing).

**AI Business Solutions:**
- Assessment VP: "Identify where AI agents can deliver measurable productivity gains in your operations — with a vendor-agnostic roadmap before committing to implementation."
- SI VP: "Deploy Copilot and AI agents with tested integration to your workflows — measurable ROI in 90 days or defined kill criteria."
- Outsourcing VP: "Operate AI-augmented processes with guaranteed SLAs — you focus on business outcomes, we run the stack."
- Proof points: Copilot deployment outcomes, agent automation ROI, process time reduction metrics.

**Security:**
- Assessment VP: "Map your actual exposure under LGPD, BACEN, or sector regulation — specific gaps, not theoretical risk."
- SI VP: "Deploy Zero Trust architecture integrated with your Microsoft stack — compliance milestone achieved by [date]."
- Outsourcing VP: "24/7 managed security posture with SLA-backed incident response — your compliance is our contractual obligation."
- Proof points: LGPD compliance delivery, BACEN resolution, HIMSS for healthcare, incident cost avoidance.

**Cloud & AI Platforms:**
- Assessment VP: "Quantify migration ROI, identify hidden on-premise costs, and produce an Azure roadmap with TCO comparison."
- SI VP: "Execute cloud migration with validated architecture — zero business disruption, predictable cost to completion."
- Outsourcing VP: "Managed Azure operations at optimized unit economics — ongoing FinOps included."
- Proof points: migration ROI delivered, cloud unit economics reduction, platform modernization speed.

**Advisory:**
- Assessment VP: "Produce strategic clarity on your technology agenda — executive alignment, prioritized roadmap, investment case."
- SI VP: "Strategic governance alongside delivery — ensures the program stays aligned to business outcomes, not just technical milestones."
- Proof points: executive adoption rate, roadmap quality scored at delivery, decision velocity improvement.

Translate each value prop into buyer-specific language using Challenger Selling (Tailor):
- CIO: technical capability + delivery risk reduction
- CFO: ROI, payback period, cost avoidance
- COO: operational outcomes, SLA, FTE impact
- CDO/Innovation: speed to value, competitive positioning

### Phase 3: Entry and Expansion Motion

**Entry motion by tier:**

| Tier | Entry Motion | Recommended First Offer |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| MVC | Executive-led. Long relationship cycle. Co-sell with Microsoft ATU. | Assessment or direct SI depending on pipeline maturity |
| High Growth | BDE-qualified. Expansion-first thinking from day 1. | Assessment to reduce risk before SI commitment |
| Emerging | DDC digital touch. Low-touch qualification. | Hero Offer (packaged Assessment) or Assessment |
| Whitespace | DDC-led. No relationship yet. | Hero Offer as optional entry — OR direct SI if an inbound qualified opportunity exists |

**Hero Offer design (when applicable):**
- Fixed-fee, $30–75K, 2–6 weeks
- Clear deliverable: diagnostic report, roadmap, architecture recommendation
- Designed to reduce perceived risk for first engagement
- Must have defined success criteria that create natural SI proposal opportunity
- NOT a mandatory gate — if client wants SI directly and qualification supports it, proceed

**Expansion arc (Assessment → SI → Outsourcing):**
- Arc is a strategic path, not a required sequence
- Assessment exit criteria → SI: client has approved roadmap, budget allocated, scope defined
- SI exit criteria → Outsourcing: delivery quality validated, operational handover defined, multi-year appetite confirmed
- Expansion timing triggers: delivery milestone, regulatory event, leadership change, contract renewal, M&A activity

**Pre-sales investment governance:**
- PURE Tier 1 (10–12): full pre-sales investment authorized
- PURE Tier 2 (7–9): limited investment — qualification call + brief proposal; escalate if champion confirmed
- PURE Tier 3 (4–6): no pre-sales hours; nurture via DDC
- PURE Tier 4 (0–3): disqualify

### Phase 4: Win Metrics and GTM Canvas

**Win metrics by offer type:**

| Offer | Leading Metric | Lagging Metric | Health Signal |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Assessment | Conversion to SI proposal (target: >40%) | Time-to-proposal | Client NPS post-delivery |
| System Integration | Win rate in competitive eval | Delivery margin | Reference-ability post-delivery |
| Outsourcing | Contract duration | FTE displacement ratio | SLA achievement + renewal rate |
| Shared Services | Process coverage % | Cost per process | Cross-geography expansion |

**GTM Canvas output (1-page per offer × tier):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ GTM CANVAS: [Offer Type] × [Account Tier]                   │

├───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┤
│ PRE-SALES GATE (PURE)     │ WIN METRICS                      │
└───────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Critical Rules

- NEVER design GTM without specifying the offer type AND account tier — the motion is fundamentally different across combinations
- NEVER produce value prop without translating it into buyer-specific language — CFO hears different value than CIO
- NEVER force the Assessment → SI sequence — if direct SI qualification is solid, proceed
- ALWAYS include expansion arc — an Assessment without expansion path is a one-time transaction, not GTM
- ALWAYS define pre-sales governance gate — without it, pre-sales hours will be spent on Tier 3/4 accounts
- NEVER ignore Microsoft co-sell potential — Avanade/Microsoft co-sell relationship is a differentiation asset
- ALWAYS identify whether Hero Offer is justified by context, not default

## Example Usage

1. "Build GTM Canvas for AI Business Solutions Assessment in the MVC tier — FSI sector, entering Bradesco"
2. "Structure the expansion from a Cloud Assessment to a $500K SI at Safra — what needs to be true?"
3. "Define Security value prop for High Growth in the CMT sector — for CFO and CIO"
4. "Review Outsourcing GTM in Emerging — where is the gap between our motion and what the market needs?"
5. "Create GTM Canvas for Shared Services in HPS — Advisory pillar, MVC tier, entry already made via Assessment"
```

**Step 3: Validate**

```bash
./scripts/validate-skill-yaml.sh skills/consulting-gtm-designer
./scripts/validate-skill-content.sh skills/consulting-gtm-designer
```
Expected: no errors

## Overview

Designed for Avanade and Microsoft partner consulting practices. Builds complete GTM strategy for the four offer types (Assessment, System Integration, Outsourcing, Shared Services) across the four operational account tiers (MVC, High Growth, Emerging, Whitespace).

Produces: offer definition, value proposition translated per Microsoft pillar and buyer persona, entry motion by tier, expansion arc with exit criteria, pre-sales governance gates using PURE scoring, and win metrics per offer type.

Explicitly designed around the reality that Hero Offer is an optional entry tool — not a mandatory gate — and that direct SI qualification is valid when supported by evidence.

## When to Use

- Designing or refreshing GTM for a consulting offer × account tier combination
- Translating Microsoft pillar messaging into buyer-specific value propositions
- Planning entry motion for new accounts or new verticals
- Structuring the Assessment → SI → Outsourcing expansion arc
- Governing pre-sales investment with PURE-based go/no-go criteria

## Example Outputs

**GTM Canvas:** 1-page canvas per offer × tier combination with ICP, value prop, entry motion, expansion arc, and win metrics

**Value Prop Translation:** Per pillar (AI Biz Solutions, Security, Cloud & AI, Advisory) × per buyer (CIO, CFO, COO)

**Expansion Arc:** Exit criteria, timing triggers, and governance gates between offer stages
```

## Batch 2: Advanced Skills (pending Batch 1 approval)

> **Gate:** Implement Batch 2 only after Batch 1 (microsoft-consulting-icp + consulting-gtm-designer) is reviewed and approved.

### Skill 3: `presales-qualifier`

**Purpose:** Pre-sales qualification framework for Microsoft consulting deals. Combines consultative BANT (DDC SAL process) + adapted MEDDPICC + structured go/no-go. Governs pre-sales investment hours and defines kill conditions.

**Integrated frameworks:** BANT (DDC qualification for SAL handoff), MEDDPICC (enterprise deal governance: Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion, Competition), SPICED (Critical Event for presales timing), Sandler Pain 3 levels (surface pain → business impact → personal consequence).

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Qualify this Outsourcing opportunity for Bradesco"
- "What is the go/no-go for investing pre-sales in this MVC account?"
- "Our win-rate is low — help review qualification criteria"
- "Full MEDDPICC for this $800K SI opportunity"
- "Define kill conditions for this deal — 3 months with no progress"

**Content specification:**

Phase 1: Consultative BANT (DDC SAL Qualification)
- Budget: confirmed budget or anticipated approval (right question: "What is the budget approval process for this project?")
- Authority: economic buyer identified and accessible (right question: "Who signs the contract? Have we spoken with this person?")
- Need: specific pain articulated with financial impact (not just "interest")
- Timeline: forcing function present (Sandler: what is the consequence of not resolving by [date]?)
- Output: SAL qualification score → MQL vs. SQL decision

Phase 2: MEDDPICC Scoring (Enterprise Deals)
- Metrics: ROI quantified with baseline (before/after)
- Economic Buyer: mapped, accessible, engaged
- Decision Criteria: client evaluation criteria documented
- Decision Process: buying process understood, next steps clear
- Identify Pain: business pain validated with Sandler 3 levels
- Champion: internal coach with political credibility identified
- Competition: competitive landscape mapped, positioning defined
- Score: 0–3 per dimension. Total ≥ 18 = pursue actively. 12–17 = qualify further. <12 = disqualify or nurture

Phase 3: Go/No-Go Decision + Pre-Sales Governance
- Pre-sales investment tiers by PURE + MEDDPICC combined score
- Kill conditions: define explicit signals to stop investing (3+ months no progress, Economic Buyer inaccessible, champion left, competitor blocked)
- SPICED Critical Event: "What is the event that makes this project urgent for the client?" — without Critical Event = no urgency = long tail or dead pipeline

Phase 4: Win-Rate Tracking by Offer × Tier
- Track win-rate by: offer type, account tier, vertical, lead source (inbound, co-sell, outbound)
- Identify pattern: where is qualification failing? Inflated Tier 3/4 pipeline?
- Recommendation: calibrate ICP with actual win-rate data

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER approve pre-sales investment without identified Champion
- NEVER skip SPICED Critical Event question — no urgency = no deal in reasonable timeframe
- ALWAYS score MEDDPICC explicitly — gut feel is not qualification
- ALWAYS define kill conditions at deal entry, not mid-pursuit
- NEVER conflate DDC SAL qualification with enterprise deal qualification — different rigor required

---

### Skill 4: `consulting-pursuit-governance`

**Purpose:** Governance of consulting pursuits — opportunity scorecard, pre-sales investment gates, Continue/Stop decision, and kill signals. Prevents pipeline inflation and bad deals.

**Integrated frameworks:** MEDDPICC (deal scorecard), Strategic Selling (buying influence map, win concession strategy), Conceptual Selling (UFC — Understanding, Fulfill, Commit), JOLT Effect (when client is paralyzed by risk — when to stop waiting).

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Build the pursuit scorecard for this $1.2M opportunity"
- "What is the go/no-go decision to keep investing pre-sales in Cielo?"
- "Identify kill signals in this deal — 5 months of stall"
- "How do I structure pursuit governance for opportunities above $500K?"
- "The client is stuck, not deciding — how do I apply JOLT here?"

**Content specification:**

Phase 1: Pursuit Scorecard
- Opportunity dimensions: strategic value (tier × offer size), win probability (MEDDPICC score), delivery capacity (can we staff and deliver?), reference value (will client be referenceable?)
- Score 0–3 each dimension, weighted by offer type
- Go/No-Go threshold per tier: MVC = pursue at lower win prob threshold (strategic), Whitespace = pursue only if high win prob

Phase 2: Pre-Sales Investment Gates
- Gate 0 → Gate 1 (Initial qualification): BANT + sponsor identified → authorize discovery call
- Gate 1 → Gate 2 (Proposal): MEDDPICC ≥ 14 + champion confirmed + budget signal → authorize proposal investment
- Gate 2 → Gate 3 (Final proposal/orals): MEDDPICC ≥ 20 + Economic Buyer engaged + competitive position clear → full team investment
- Each gate: investment authorized, roles required, deliverables, timeline

Phase 3: Continue/Stop Decision Framework
- Continue signals: progress on MEDDPICC dimensions, champion active, timeline maintained, executive engagement
- Stop signals (JOLT Effect): >3 months no progress on decision criteria, Economic Buyer inaccessible, champion lost influence, competitor installed on parallel track, budget reallocated
- JOLT application: when client is paralyzed by risk — clarify "omission" (cost of not deciding) vs. "commission" (risk of deciding wrong); create safe path to decide
- Kill authorization: define who authorizes kill decision and when retrospective happens

Phase 4: Post-Pursuit Learning
- Win: what drove the win? Replicable pattern?
- Loss: which MEDDPICC dimension failed earliest? Where was the miss?
- No-decision: what caused paralysis? Could JOLT have helped?
- Quarterly review: win-rate by offer × tier, average pursuit cost by tier, kill ratio target

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER advance a deal past Gate 2 without Economic Buyer engaged
- NEVER keep a deal alive past 4 months of no MEDDPICC progress — kill or suspend
- ALWAYS document kill decision rationale — prevents same mistake on next similar deal
- ALWAYS conduct post-pursuit retrospective within 2 weeks of win or loss
- NEVER conflate "client is slow" with "deal is alive" — JOLT or kill

### Skill 5: `executive-account-briefing`

**Purpose:** Generates executive briefings for C-level meetings in Microsoft/Avanade accounts. Executive profile, meeting agenda, discovery questions calibrated by persona, and strategic conversational hooks.

**Integrated frameworks:** Challenger Selling (Tailor pillar — customize insight delivery to specific persona), Conceptual Selling (Personal Win — what does THIS executive win if this project succeeds?), SPIN Selling (Implication questions calibrated to executive level — business consequence, not technical detail).

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Prepare executive briefing for CIO meeting at Bradesco tomorrow"
- "What are the right questions for a CFO in first SI meeting?"
- "Build agenda for Executive Business Review with C-level at Safra"
- "Generate executive profile and conversational hooks for new CDO at Cielo"
- "Prepare discovery questions for CFO evaluating Outsourcing"

**Content specification:**

Phase 1: Executive Profile Generation
- Role context: CIO vs. CFO vs. COO vs. CDO — different worldview, different success metrics, different fears
- LinkedIn + news research protocol: recent statements, strategic priorities, tenure, known initiatives, industry context
- Personal Win mapping: what does this executive win personally if this project succeeds? (Conceptual Selling)
- Risk profile: what is their biggest career risk right now? How does our offer mitigate or create risk for them?

Phase 2: Meeting Agenda Design
- Agenda structure by meeting type:
  - First contact (30 min): 5 min rapport → 10 min insight delivery (Challenger Tailor) → 10 min discovery questions → 5 min next step proposal
  - Executive Business Review (60 min): 5 min recap → 15 min business review → 15 min strategic insight → 15 min deep discovery → 10 min proposal → 5 min close/next step
- Challenger Tailor: prepare 1 insight specific to their industry + role that reframes their problem — not a product pitch

Phase 3: Discovery Questions by Persona
- CIO questions: "What is your biggest technology risk in the next 12 months?" / "Where is your current architecture limiting your business ambitions?" / "What does good look like for your team in 2 years?"
- CFO questions: "What is the cost of maintaining the current state for 3 more years?" / "How are you measuring technology ROI today?" / "What would need to be true for this investment to be approved?"
- COO questions: "Where are your operations most exposed to disruption?" / "What processes are consuming disproportionate FTE today?" / "What is your SLA reliability and where are the gaps?"
- CDO/Innovation questions: "What is your biggest obstacle to AI adoption in production?" / "Where are your experiments failing to scale?" / "What does your board expect from you on AI in the next 12 months?"

Phase 4: Strategic Hooks and Follow-Up Design
- Conversational hooks: 2–3 industry-specific observations that provoke thinking (Challenger insight delivery)
- SPIN Implication questions: move from situation (facts) to problem (acknowledgment) to implication (business consequence) to need-payoff (solution value)
- Meeting close: always leave with a defined next step, timeline, and responsible person — no open-ended "we'll follow up"
- Follow-up template: within 24 hours, 3 bullets — what we discussed, what we'll do next, what we need from them

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER enter an executive meeting without knowing the Personal Win for that specific executive
- NEVER lead with product features — lead with insight about their industry or business
- ALWAYS define a specific next step before leaving the meeting
- ALWAYS calibrate SPIN questions to executive level — no technical detail unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use generic discovery questions — every question must reference their industry, role, or known context

### Skill 6: `microsoft-cosell-strategy`

**Purpose:** Co-sell strategy with Microsoft for Avanade accounts. Maps ATU/STU/CSU roles, assesses co-sell readiness, defines engagement strategy per offer, and identifies access to funding/incentives (MACC, Solution Play funding, FastTrack, ADS).

**Integrated frameworks:** GTM Mastery Avanade — co-sell section (co-sell as most underutilized channel), Solution Plays, Microsoft investment vehicles.

**Trigger phrases:**
- "How do I engage the ATU at Bradesco for co-sell on our AI proposal?"
- "What is our co-sell readiness for this Security offer?"
- "Identify Microsoft funding opportunities for this MVC account"
- "Build co-sell strategy with STU for an $800K Cloud Migration deal"
- "How do I access MACC or ADS for this Outsourcing project?"

**Content specification:**

Phase 1: Microsoft Account Team Mapping
- ATU (Account Team Unit — sales): owns the commercial relationship, manages Microsoft revenue targets, co-sell incentive is territory revenue
- STU (Specialist Team Unit — pre-sales): technical specialists per workload (Azure, Security, Modern Work, Business Applications), owns technical close
- CSU (Customer Success Unit — post-sale): ensures adoption and consumption, impacts renewal and expansion
- Map: who is the ATU for this account? Is the relationship warm or cold? What is their current priority for this account?
- Signal: ATU with active pipeline = highest co-sell alignment opportunity

Phase 2: Co-Sell Readiness Scoring
- Offer alignment: is our offer on the Microsoft Solution Plays list?
- Technical alignment: does our SI use Azure-native services? (consumption = co-sell credit for ATU)
- Deal size: is the deal large enough to warrant ATU time? (<$50K rarely gets ATU attention)
- Timing: is the ATU's fiscal quarter-end a leverage point?
- Score: High / Medium / Low co-sell readiness + recommended engagement approach

Phase 3: Engagement Strategy by Offer
- Assessment: invite STU to joint workshop — technical credibility + Microsoft brand
- SI: position as Solution Play delivery — ATU gets Azure consumption credit; frame as Microsoft investment
- Outsourcing: CSU alignment for adoption metrics; ATU for renewal positioning
- Hero Offer: use Microsoft-branded landing pages + partner network for Whitespace/Emerging digital entry

Phase 4: Funding and Incentives Access
- **MACC (Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment):** identify if client has MACC — if so, Azure services in SI count toward their commitment
- **Solution Play Funding:** Microsoft invests in specific workloads annually — identify active Solution Plays; apply for co-investment in qualified deals
- **FastTrack for Azure:** Microsoft-funded technical deployment assistance for Azure migrations — reduces Avanade delivery cost on qualifying SI deals
- **ADS (Azure Deployment Support):** Microsoft funding for specific deployment scenarios — identify eligible workloads
- **Partner Marketing Funds:** co-marketing budget available for joint campaigns with ATU — applicable for Emerging/Whitespace demand generation

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER approach Microsoft co-sell without ATU relationship established or in development — cold co-sell approaches fail
- NEVER miss MACC alignment check — it changes the commercial conversation entirely
- ALWAYS align offer to active Solution Plays — non-aligned offers get no Microsoft investment
- ALWAYS identify ATU fiscal quarter timing — end-of-quarter is highest co-sell leverage moment
- NEVER treat co-sell as just a funding mechanism — it is a trust-building channel with the Microsoft account team

### Skill 7: `consulting-account-expansion`

**Purpose:** Account expansion strategy for existing Avanade accounts. Account diagnosis across 5 dimensions, identification of the next expansion bet, 12–24 month roadmap, and account risk register.

**Integrated frameworks:** TAS (Target Account Selling — INVEST/DEVELOP/HARVEST/OPPORTUNISTIC quadrant), Strategic Selling (ongoing buyer committee mapping), GAP Selling (Current State vs. Future State for expansion narrative), Value Selling (economic value of expansion vs. competition).

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Build expansion strategy for Bradesco — we are already an SI supplier"
- "What is the next expansion bet for Cielo? We already have Outsourcing running"
- "Run account diagnosis for Safra — identify gaps and risks"
- "Create a 12–24 month expansion roadmap for an MVC account in the FSI sector"
- "Identify loss risks at HapVida — contract renews in 6 months"

**Content specification:**

Phase 1: Account Snapshot (5 Dimensions)
- Current revenue and YoY trend (growing, stable, at risk?)
- Offer coverage: which of the 4 offer types do we have? What is missing?
- Relationship depth: how many C-level contacts do we have? Are they advocates, neutral, or risks?
- Microsoft alignment: how strong is our co-sell partnership on this account? ATU engaged?
- Competitive exposure: is a competitor actively pursuing this account? Any displacement risk?
- TAS quadrant assignment: INVEST / DEVELOP / HARVEST / OPPORTUNISTIC based on strategic value × relationship strength

Phase 2: Expansion Bet Identification
- Gap analysis: Current State (current Avanade coverage) → Future State (potential expansion) → Gap Impact (revenue opportunity + risk of not expanding)
- Offer expansion plays:
  - Assessment → SI: client has roadmap, is ready to build
  - SI → Outsourcing: delivery delivered, operations candidate
  - Outsourcing → Shared Services: operational maturity achieved, scale opportunity
  - Any offer → New pillar: client in AI Biz Solutions, open door to Security or Cloud expansion
- Prioritize bets by: Strategic Value × Win Probability × Timing (is there a forcing function?)
- Identify 1–3 concrete expansion bets with evidence

Phase 3: 12–24 Month Expansion Roadmap
- Quarter-by-quarter expansion arc
- Each quarter: objective, offer target, key stakeholder to engage, milestone, success criteria
- Funding events to target: budget cycle, contract renewal, leadership change, regulatory mandate
- Microsoft co-sell integration: align expansion bets with ATU priorities and Solution Play calendar

Phase 4: Account Risk Register
- Risk categories: relationship risk (key sponsor left), competitive risk (displacement active), delivery risk (current contract in trouble), budget risk (client cutting IT spend), regulatory risk (compliance event impacting our delivery)
- For each risk: probability (H/M/L), impact (H/M/L), mitigation action, owner, timeline
- Green/Yellow/Red account health signal per dimension
- Renewal readiness: if contract renewing in <12 months, what is the renewal strategy?

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER expand into new offer without delivery quality on current offer validated
- NEVER build expansion roadmap without identifying the Economic Buyer for each expansion bet
- ALWAYS include risk register — expansion plans without risk awareness lead to surprises
- ALWAYS align expansion bets with Microsoft ATU priorities — co-sell on expansion is even more powerful than on new logos
- NEVER treat HARVEST accounts like INVEST accounts — different coverage model, different investment level

---

## Task 3: Regenerate Indexes (After Each Batch)

After each batch of skills is created and validated:

**Step 1: Regenerate skills index**

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-skills-index.py
```
Expected: `skills_index.json` updated

**Step 2: Regenerate catalog**

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-catalog.py
```
Expected: `CATALOG.md` updated

**Step 3: Verify git status**

```bash
git status --short
```
Expected: only intentional changes

---

## Task 4: Update Documentation (Pre-Release)

**Files to update before next release (do NOT change version now):**
- `README.md` — add skills to GTM/Sales category table; bump badge from 55 to 57 (Batch 1) then 62 (Batch 2)
- `CLAUDE.md` — add skills to architecture tree and Skill Types section
- `CHANGELOG.md` — add entry for new skills
- `cli-installer/README.md` — update skill count
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — update description if skill count changed
- `bundles.json` — evaluate: `microsoft-consulting-icp` + `consulting-gtm-designer` in `product` bundle; `presales-qualifier` + `consulting-pursuit-governance` in `product` bundle

**Version bump (deferred to release):**
```bash
node scripts/release.js minor
```
Batch 1 (2 skills): 1.22.x → 1.23.0
Batch 2 (5 skills): 1.23.x → 1.24.0

---

## Validation Criteria (Both Batches)

Before marking implementation complete for any skill:

- [ ] `SKILL.md` frontmatter has ONLY `name`, `description`, `license`
- [ ] NO `created`, `updated`, `version`, `author` in any `SKILL.md`
- [ ] `README.md` has complete Metadata table with dates and version
- [ ] Passes `validate-skill-yaml.sh` and `validate-skill-content.sh`
- [ ] Word count: 1500–2000 (max 5000) per skill
- [ ] `skills_index.json` and `CATALOG.md` regenerated after each batch
- [ ] No changes to `bundles.json`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or version files (release-time only)
- [ ] Skills look native to repository — no foreign structure, no verbatim imported content
- [ ] Hero Offer positioned as optional (never as required gate) in all relevant skills
- [ ] MVC/HG/Emerging/Whitespace used as primary segmentation (Enterprise/SMC as secondary context)
- [ ] Framework references are Avanade-contextualized, not generic copies from 21 Frameworks doc

---

## Success Criteria

This plan succeeds when:
- All 7 skills are in `skills/` with valid structure and content
- MVC/HG/Emerging/Whitespace segmentation is consistent across all skills
- Hero Offer is correctly positioned as option across all relevant skills
- Each skill has distinct, non-overlapping scope from the others and from `abx-strategy` / `product-strategy`
- Eric can invoke any skill and receive structured output relevant to his VP/GTM context at Avanade
- Indexes regenerated and up to date
- Implementation can proceed without architectural ambiguity
